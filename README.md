# Seeds 

A repository full of programming examples to be systematically taught to students in a STEM Academy.

## Implementation 

Examples and Projects will be implemented in different programming languages to facilitate comprehension. The documentation accompanying all code will help students duplicate segments for their own programming projects. All code will be developed with Visual Studio code and ran using various command-line iterpreters and integrated development environments (IDE).  

## Principles 

    - Program Structure 
    - Documentation 
    - Naming Conventions 
    - Functions
    - Scoping
    - Variables 
    - Conditions
    - Input / Output 
    - Objects 
    - Program Structure 
    - Execution  

## Topics
