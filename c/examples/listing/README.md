# Listing 

This example uses a listing algorithm to prove programming principles. 

## Principles

    - Program Structure 
    - Documentation 
    - Naming Conventions 
    - Functions 
    - Variables 
    - Conditions
    - Looping
    - Input / Output
    - Execution

## Usage 

From within the src directory, compile the code into it's executable form and run one of the following scripts to execute the code (machine dependent): 
```

.\main.exe 
```
